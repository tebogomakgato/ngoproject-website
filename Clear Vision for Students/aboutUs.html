We focus on early detection of vision problems through screenings, offering free spectacles, and ensuring that students get the necessary adjustments to improve their vision.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to enhance students' learning experience by addressing their vision problems. By providing vision screenings and corrective lenses to students who need them, we aim to ensure that every student can succeed in their education without the obstacle of poor eyesight.</p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>We envision a future where no student is held back due to poor vision. Our ultimate goal is to establish accessible eye care services in every educational institution.</p>
            
            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2024, Clear Sight for Students began with a small team of eye care professionals who saw the need to address vision problems among students. Since our inception, we have served over 100 students in our pilot program, with plans to expand nationwide.</p>
